# Dolphin | Finance Manager

## About

Dolphin is a desktop financial management application that focuses on simplicity and the most basic features of a financial manager. If you use Excel, Dolphin is an alternative for you who don't want to waste time looking for a financial spreadsheet template or building your own in Excel. It's designed to make your life easier, but not to track your accounts and earnings for a specific period. It's that simple.

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.
